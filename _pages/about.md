I am Dr. Abdelghani Dahou, an Associate Professor at the University of Ahmed Draia in Adrar, Algeria, and a Postdoctoral Researcher at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang Normal University, China. With a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Wuhan University of Technology, my journey in academia and research has been driven by a passion for innovation and growth in the field of machine learning.

My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, neural architecture search, and NeuroEvolution. I have a profound commitment to applying these advanced techniques across various domains, including human activity recognition, multi-task learning, meta-learning, image processing, intrusion detection systems, healthcare, medical image processing, and natural language processing. My work aims to contribute to the advancement of computer science by offering novel insights and solutions to complex problems. I have listed among the researchers for the 2% Scientists Worldwide 2024 by Stanford University list (Stanford Elsevier Top Scientists List).

As a dedicated and self-motivated professional, I thrive in collaborative environments and am eager to lead and contribute to projects that push the boundaries of our understanding in computer science. My academic and research endeavors are a testament to my commitment to excellence and my continuous pursuit of professional development.
